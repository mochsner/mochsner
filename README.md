- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ About
  - Studied Management Science and Computer Science (Bayesian Networks), using C#, Python/C++ and some Java
  - Worked across healthcare, manufacturing, government contracting and even a little bit of real estate.
  - <3 Linux / open source (will go slightly out of my way for alternatives to big tech offerings)
  - [Change my mind] I'm of the opinion that sources and 'why' an answer is true are more important than 'what' the answer is. Absorbing information without (evidence | source | identity | context) is an ethical gray area.
